# Blinkit_PowerBI_Analysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution using Power BI. The primary focus was to identify critical KPIs, analyze trends, and generate actionable insights to optimize business strategies.

Key Metrics Identified:

-Total Sales: Overall revenue generated from all items sold.
-Average Sales: The average revenue per transaction.
-Number of Items: The count of unique items sold.
-Average Rating: The customer satisfaction scores for sold items.
Chart Analysis and Visualizations Developed:

-Total Sales by Fat Content: Used Donut Chart to analyze the impact of fat content on total sales and additional KPIs.
-Sales by Item Type: Built a Bar Chart to identify top-performing item categories and how they influence key sales metrics.
-Outlet Sales Performance:
--Compared total sales by fat content for different outlets using a Stacked Column Chart.
--Correlated outlet size with sales using a Donut/Pie Chart.
-Geographic Analysis: Created a Funnel Map to assess sales distribution across various outlet locations.
-Consolidated Metrics: Designed a Matrix Card providing an overview of Total Sales, Average Sales, Item Count, and Average Ratings by outlet type.
